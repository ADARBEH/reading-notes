## What is a ‘call’?

#### At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
---
## How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

#### Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom.
---

## What does LIFO mean?
#### When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
---
### Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

## What causes a Stack Overflow?
#### One of the most common causes of a stack overflow is the recursive function, a type of function that repeatedly calls itself in an attempt to carry out specific logic. 
---

## What is a ‘reference error’?

#### This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type of errors
---
## What is a ‘syntax error’?

#### I know it’s in the name of the errors, but like it says itself, this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
---
## What is a ‘range error’?

#### Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

---
## What is a ‘tyep error’?

#### Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
---

## What is a breakpoint?

#### is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause.
---
## What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

#### Debugging is the process of analyzing how your program runs, how it generates data in order to find defects and issues in your code. These errors or defects are referred to as “bugs”, hence the term “debugging.”
