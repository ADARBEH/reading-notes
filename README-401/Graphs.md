## What is a Graph Data Structure?
#### A Graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.

## type of Graphs

### Undirected Graphs
#### In an undirected graph, edges are not directed. This means that if there is an edge between vertex 1 and vertex 2, then there is also an edge between vertex 2 and vertex 1. The following figure shows an undirected graph.

### Directed Graphs
#### In a directed graph, edges are directed. This means that if there is an edge between vertex 1 and vertex 2, then there is no edge between vertex 2 and vertex 1. The following figure shows a directed graph.

### conected Graphs
#### A connected graph is a graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices. The following figure shows a connected graph.

### Disconnected Graphs
#### A disconnected graph is a graph in which there is no path between some pairs of vertices. The following figure shows a disconnected graph.

### Difference between graph and tree
#### A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A graph can be a tree or not a tree.
