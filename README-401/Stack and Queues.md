## What's the difference between Stack and Queue?

| **Stack**| **Queue**|  
| ----------- | ----------- |  
| The stack is based on LIFO(Last In First Out) principle| The queue is based on FIFO(First In First Out) principle.|  
| Insertion Operation is called Push Operation| Insertion Operation is called Enqueue Operation|
| Deletion Operation is called Pop Operation| Deletion Operation is called Dequeue Operation|
| Push and Pop Operation takes place from one end of the stack| Enqueue and Dequeue Operation takes place from a different end of the queue|

## What is Stacks and how to use it?
#### Stack is a linear data structure that follows the specific order to perform the operations. For example,  In the stack, we insert the element from one end with push operation and delete the element from the same end using pop operation. The end of the stack used to perform all the operations is called the top of the stack.

## What is Queue?
#### The queue is a linear data structure in which we can insert the element from one side of the list and delete the element from the other side of the list. The end of the list from where the elements are inserted is called the rear end and the end from where the elements are deleted is called the front end. Therefore, the queue data structure follows the FIFO(First In First Out) principle, which means the element inserted first from the rear end will be the first element to be deleted from the front end.
