## Review and Research


### How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?

#### If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once , you can pass an empty array ([]) 

### Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?

### No , you can call it multiple times but it will re-render the component multiple times
---

### Is useState() synchronous?

#### No, it is asynchronous. It is not guaranteed that the state has changed when the function ends.
