## five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
| SQL | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|  databases are relational |  databases are non-relational. |
|  databases use structured query language | databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data |
| databases are vertically scalable | databases are horizontally scalable. |
| databases are better for multi-row transactions | while NoSQL is better for unstructured 
data like documents or JSON. |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

#### Choosing a database depends majorly on the type of data that your project needs to store. If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined , conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

### Give a real world example.

#### for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

#### data from molecular modeling, Geo-spatial information, and satellite data are highly unstructured. Likewise, data from social media analysis and websites is also highly unstructured, and relationships among the data entities are not clearly defined. In such scenarios, NoSQL is a better choice

### Give a real world example.

#### For example, a data mining application should utilize the power of NoSQL database rather than conventional SQL.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

### NoSQL 

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

### SQL

## What does SQL stand for?
#### Structured Query Language

## What is a relational database?

#### A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
---
## What is a NoSQL database?
#### NoSQL Database is a non-relational Data Management System, that does not require a fixed schema. It avoids joins,
---
## What type of structure does a relational database work with?

#### its SQL, SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
---
## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

#### While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID
